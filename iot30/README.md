## Session Abstract

The cloud is for many scenarios the way to process data and apply business logic. But processing data in the cloud is not always the way to go, because of connectivity, legal issues or because you need to respond in near-real time.

In this session we dive into how [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) 
can help in this scenario. We will train a machine learning model in the cloud using the 
[Microsoft AI Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=ai-machine-learning&WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) and deploy this model to an IoT Edge device using 
[Azure IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa).
