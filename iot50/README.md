## Session Abstract

In this session we will explore strategies for secure IoT device connectivity in real-world edge environments, specifically how use of the [Azure IoT Edge Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-as-gateway?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) can accommodate offline, intermittent, legacy environments by means of Gateway configuration patterns.  We will then look at implementations of Artificial Intelligence at the Edge in a variety of business verticals, by adapting a common [IoT reference architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) to accommodate specific business needs.  Finally, we will conclude with techniques for implementing artificial intelligence at the edge to support an [Intelligent Video Analytics solution](http://aka.ms/iot50/intelligentvideo), by walking through a project which integrates Azure IoT Edge with an [NVIDIA DeepStream SDK module](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/nvidia.deepstream-iot?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) and a custom object detection model built using [CustomVision.AI](https://www.customvision.ai/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) to create an end-to-end solution that allows for visualization of object detection telemetry in Azure services like [Time Series Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa) and [PowerBI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/?WT.mc_id=sciot-video-cxa).
